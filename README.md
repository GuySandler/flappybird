# Flappy bird (ish)

My first real game.

My take on the basic flappy bird game but without all the animation and art because I'm not very good at that (the player is meant to be orpheus but it's too low res).

Press upArrow to go up (no cooldown)

Don't hit the ceiling, floor, or pipes

Your score shows highscore on the main menu and current score after passing 1

Press G to enable night mode for lower gravity and a harder challange

Made in godot 4 and sprites are made in Asprite
